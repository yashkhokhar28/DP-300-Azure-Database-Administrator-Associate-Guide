# Azure SQL Deployment and Migration: A Comprehensive Guide

This guide consolidates critical information on deploying and migrating SQL Server databases to Azure, covering **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS)**, **Azure SQL Database (PaaS)**, and **Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)**. It provides a unified resource for database administrators and IT professionals seeking to modernize their SQL Server workloads with minimal disruption, optimal performance, and robust security.

## Why Choose Azure for SQL Server?

Deploying SQL Server workloads in Azure offers flexibility, scalability, and reduced infrastructure management. Azure provides three primary deployment models, each tailored to specific needs:

- **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS):** Offers full control over the operating system and SQL Server, ideal for "lift-and-shift" migrations of on-premises setups with minimal changes.
- **Azure SQL Database (PaaS):** A fully managed service for modern cloud-native applications, requiring minimal administrative overhead.
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS):** Combines near-complete SQL Server compatibility with PaaS benefits, perfect for modernizing legacy applications with minimal code changes.

### Real-World Example

A **retail company** with a product catalog database powers its website, mobile apps, and analytics tools. By moving to **Azure SQL Managed Instance**, the company migrates its database with no code changes, leveraging Azureâ€™s automated backups and high availability. Alternatively, a **financial firm** with strict compliance requirements keeps its production SQL Server on-premises but uses **Azure VMs for disaster recovery** and **Azure Blob Storage for backups**, managed centrally via **Azure Arc**.

- Disable auto-statistics updates temporarily.
- Place files in the target region to reduce latency.
- Implement **exponential backoff** for retries (e.g., 5s â†’ 10s â†’ 20s).

**Retry Logic Example:**
If a SELECT query fails:

1. Wait 5 seconds.
2. Retry with a new connection.
3. Increase wait time if needed.

### BACPAC Files

A `.bacpac` file is a compressed archive of schema and data, ideal for offline migrations.

**How to Use:**

```bash
SqlPackage.exe /a:import /sf:AdventureWorks.bacpac
```

**Limitations:**

- Requires downtime.
- Excludes logins, jobs, and linked servers.
- Not suitable for databases >200 GB.

### Transactional Replication

For online migrations with no downtime:
