## ✅ **Why Monitor Availability?**

After setting up **High Availability (HA)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)** features for your Azure SQL services, you must continuously **monitor them** to make sure they are working properly and that you are meeting your **availability goals** (**RTO**, **RPO**, and **SLA**).

Monitoring helps you:

- Detect and respond to outages faster.
- Ensure your databases and applications stay available.
- Keep performance and reliability high.

---

## 🎯 **Key Questions to Plan Your Strategy**

When building your availability monitoring strategy, think about these:

- Do you need backups for **only 1–35 days** or for the **long term**?
- What are your **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**?
- Which **Azure SQL service tier** (Basic, Standard, Premium, Business Critical) meets your SLA needs?
- Do you require **Availability Zones** for more fault tolerance?
- Should you use **geo-replication** or **auto-failover groups** for disaster recovery?
- **Is your application designed for availability?**
  (Example: Does it handle retries, and is it located near the database to reduce network latency?)

## 🔍 **What Should You Monitor?**

### 1. **Azure Regional and Datacenter Status**

- **Azure Status Page:** Shows global outages for any Azure services/regions.

  - Get alerts via **RSS feed**.

- **Azure Service Health:** Alerts you about service problems, maintenance, and outages in your subscription.

  - Can notify you by **email or SMS**.

---

### 2. **Database & Managed Instance Status**

You can monitor your database’s availability using:

- **Azure Portal:** Resource Health and performance charts.
- **Azure CLI:** Example commands:

  - `az sql mi list` → Lists Managed Instance status.
  - `az sql db list` → Lists database status.

- **PowerShell:**

  - `Get-AzSQLDatabase` → Lists databases and their availability status.

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** Connect to check status using T-SQL.
- **REST APIs:** Advanced option to programmatically check health.

---

### 3. **Backup and Restore Monitoring**

- Azure automatically performs backups, but you can:

  - See **long-term backup retention (LTR)** in the Azure Portal/CLI.
  - Use **XEvents** on Managed Instance to track backup history.
  - Check the **Azure Activity Log** for database restores and creation events.

---

### 4. **Replica Health (Business Critical Tier)**

Use this query in T-SQL to check the health of replicas:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_database_replica_states
```

---

### 5. **Find Out Why Failover Happened**

If a failover occurs:

- Check **Resource Health** in the Azure Portal or REST API.
- This shows whether it was planned maintenance or an unexpected failure.

---

### 6. **Advanced Monitoring: System Center**

If your organization uses **System Center**, there’s a **Management Pack** available for Azure SQL to monitor availability.

---

## 🛡️ **Final Note on Applications**

Availability isn’t only about the database!
✔️ Place your **application and database in the same region** to reduce latency.
✔️ Add **retry logic** to your apps to handle brief failures or re-connections during failovers.
