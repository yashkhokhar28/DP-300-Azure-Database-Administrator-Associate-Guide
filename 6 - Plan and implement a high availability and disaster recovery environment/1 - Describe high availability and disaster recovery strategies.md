## üß† TL;DR: HADR in Azure SQL ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Just Turn It On, Design It

You don‚Äôt get high availability or disaster recovery (HADR) just by flipping a switch in Azure. You need to **understand your business needs** (like how long you can afford to be down and how much data loss is acceptable), and then **choose the right tools** for that.

## üíº Real-World Example: Retail Company‚Äôs SQL Server

Let‚Äôs say you're running a large e-commerce platform:

- If your site is down for more than **10 minutes**, you lose ‚Çπ50,000 in sales.
- If you lose more than **5 minutes of order data**, you mess up deliveries and inventory.

### That means your:

- **RTO = 10 mins** (how quickly you must recover)
- **RPO = 5 mins** (how much data loss is tolerable)

Now you design your HADR plan around these numbers.

## üéØ What You Need to Know First:

| Concept | Meaning                    | Example                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RTO** | How fast to recover        | If RTO is 30 mins, app must be live again in 30 mins post-crash |
| **RPO** | How much data you can lose | If RPO is 5 mins, backup must cover up to 5 mins ago            |

If your backup runs hourly, and your RPO is 5 minutes ‚Äî congrats, your plan is **trash**. Fix it.

## üîß Choose the Right Tool Based on Business Impact

| Scenario                                 | Best Fit                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Need full instance protection            | **Failover Cluster Instance (FCI)** |
| Need faster failover + read replicas     | **Availability Groups (AG)**        |
| Want cheap DR, okay with manual failover | **Log Shipping**                    |
| Just want infra-level VM failover        | **Azure Site Recovery**             |

> FCI = Old-school but strong. AG = Modern, scalable, and performance-savvy.
> Log Shipping = Grandpa solution that still works. ASR = Infra-wide DR, not SQL-aware.

## üß© VM-Level vs SQL-Level DR in Azure

| Level                   | Tools                         | Pros                   | Cons                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Infrastructure (VM)** | Availability Sets, Zones, ASR | Simple, broad coverage | Doesn‚Äôt understand SQL  |
| **SQL Server (Data)**   | AG, FCI, Log Shipping         | Precise, configurable  | Needs effort & planning |

You can‚Äôt protect SQL Server with just Azure infra tools. You still need real SQL HADR.

## üÜö IaaS vs PaaS: Know the Difference

| Azure Flavor           | You Manage                    | Microsoft Manages                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS (VM)**          | OS, SQL config, backups, HADR | Infra only                                    |
| **PaaS (SQL DB / MI)** | DB schema, queries            | Everything else (HA, patching, backups, etc.) |

If you're lazy (or smart), PaaS makes your life easy. But if you need full control, IaaS is your playground.

## üåê Hybrid DR ‚Äì A Smart Bridge Strategy

Let‚Äôs say your production SQL Server is on-prem, and you want DR in Azure:

- Use **Availability Groups** to sync a secondary in Azure.
- Keep backups in **Azure Blob Storage** for cheap long-term retention.
- Use **ExpressRoute** or VPN to ensure fast sync (public internet = no-no üî•).

Hybrid = best of both worlds (but not for PaaS ‚Äî only works with VMs).

## üß™ Final Advice: Design Like It Matters

- **Start with RTO & RPO** ‚Äî your tech should follow business risk.
- **Test your assumptions.** Don‚Äôt assume your backup strategy works. Simulate outages.
- **Document everything.** Review often.
- Choose **AG** if you need speed, **FCI** if you need instance-level DR, and **Log Shipping** if your CFO is watching the budget.

| Situation                       | Pick This                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal downtime, DB-level only | **AG**                                                |
| Protect full SQL instance       | **FCI**                                               |
| Old-school, manual DR           | **Log Shipping**                                      |
| Region-wide DR                  | **Multi-region AG** or **ASR**                        |
| PaaS SQL DB                     | Use built-in **auto-failover** or **geo-replication** |
| On-prem to Azure DR             | **Distributed AG** or **Log Shipping**                |
| Only want infra protection      | **ASR**, **Availability Sets/Zones**                  |
