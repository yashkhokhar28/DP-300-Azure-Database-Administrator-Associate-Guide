### ✅ **Summary: IaaS Options to Deploy SQL Server in Azure**

---

### 🔍 **Why Use SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS)?**

- **Legacy Compatibility:** Run **older SQL Server versions** still required by some vendors.
- **Full SQL Server Services:** Host **SSAS, SSIS, SSRS** on the same VM.
- **Custom Requirements:** Run additional software or features (e.g., CLR, cross-database queries, Active Directory authentication) not supported by PaaS offerings.

### ⚙️ **Control Level Comparison: SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS**

| Layer                        | SaaS | PaaS (e.g., Azure SQL Database) | IaaS (SQL on Azure VM) |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| SQL Server Configuration     | ❌   | Partial                         | ✅                     |
| OS & Patch Management        | ❌   | ❌                              | ✅                     |
| Full Network/Storage Control | ❌   | ❌                              | ✅                     |

In IaaS, Microsoft manages the **hardware**, but you configure the **OS, SQL Server, storage, and networking**.

### 🛡️ **SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension**

When you deploy a SQL Server VM from the Azure Marketplace, the **IaaS Agent Extension** installs automatically. It helps manage:

- Automated **backup & patching**
- **Key Vault** & **Defender for Cloud** integration
- Disk usage monitoring
- Flexible SQL version & edition deployment
- SQL best practices assessments

---

### 💰 **SQL Server Licensing Options in IaaS**

1. **Pay-as-you-go:** Pay hourly for the SQL license (bundled with the VM).
2. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):**

   - Use existing SQL Server licenses with **Software Assurance (SA)**.
   - Requires License Mobility reporting.

3. **Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB):**

   - Apply existing **Windows Server** and **SQL Server** licenses.

4. **Reserved Instances:** Pre-commit for 1-3 years to save costs on the VM.

### 🖥️ **VM Families for SQL Workloads**

Azure offers various VM series optimized for different workloads:

| Series                   | Description                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| General Purpose          | Balanced CPU/RAM for dev/test, small DBs, web apps        |
| Compute Optimized        | High CPU-to-memory ratio for batch jobs, app servers      |
| Memory Optimized         | Large RAM capacity for most SQL workloads (up to 4TB RAM) |
| Storage Optimized        | Fast, ephemeral storage for scale-out data workloads      |
| GPU                      | ML & video rendering workloads                            |
| FPGA/Accelerated         | Specialized compute workloads                             |
| High-Performance Compute | Large-scale parallel compute needs                        |

### 🛒 **Azure Marketplace**

- Simplified VM deployment using **pre-built templates**, e.g., SQL Server 2022 on Windows Server 2019.
- Quickly configure workloads for **OLTP** or **Data Warehousing**.

⚠️ **Downside:** Portal-based deployments aren’t easily repeatable (consider ARM templates for automation).

---

### 🔐 **SQL Server Configuration During Deployment**

From the Azure portal, configure:

- **SQL Authentication**
- **SQL Instance settings**
- **Firewall rules**
- **Storage & performance options**

---

### 🎯 **Key Takeaway**

SQL Server on Azure VMs is ideal when you need **full control of the OS, SQL Server services, and infrastructure**. It's the closest Azure equivalent to your on-premises environment, supporting legacy versions and full feature sets.
