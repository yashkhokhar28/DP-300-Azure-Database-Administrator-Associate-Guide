## 🎯 **The Core Challenge**

Running SQL Server on Azure is like running a high-performance kitchen in a food truck —
You need to **cook fast (performance)** without **burning too much fuel (cost)**.

---

## 🚗 Real-World Analogy to Set the Scene:

> Imagine you're running a cloud-based restaurant chain.

- Your kitchen = **SQL Server VM**
- Your fridge/pantry = **Azure Storage**
- Your chefs = **CPU Cores**
- Your kitchen tools = **Memory**
- Your temp storage shelf = **TempDB**
- Your operations manager = **Resource Governor**

You want food to fly out of the kitchen fast (performance), but you also don’t want your gas bill to bankrupt you (cost).

## 🛠️ **Key Azure Configuration Areas** (and Real-World Twist)

| Azure Setting         | What It Really Means                                                            | Real-World Version                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Azure Storage**     | Choose fast, reliable disks (Premium SSD / Ultra Disk) for your data/log files. | Fancy fridges/pantries that keep ingredients fresh and close |
| **VM Size**           | Bigger VMs = More CPU & RAM = Faster performance but higher bills.              | More chefs and cooking stations                              |
| **TempDB**            | SQL’s scratchpad — needs to be fast and not crowded. Store on local SSD.        | Temp shelf in kitchen: if cramped = chaos                    |
| **Resource Governor** | Manages CPU/memory for each workload so one doesn’t hog everything.             | Ops Manager says, “Chefs, don’t fight over the stove.”       |

## 💾 Azure Storage Optimization TL;DR

- SQL Server is **I/O hungry** — slow storage = laggy queries.
- Use **Premium SSD or Ultra Disk** for prod. Don’t get cheap here.
- **Strip disks** (combine multiple SSDs) for better IOPS & size.
- Use **Read Caching** on data disks, **no caching** on log disks.
- Store **TempDB on local D drive** (fast but resets on reboot).
- Templates from Azure Marketplace can auto-configure best storage setups.

> 📦 Like using multiple smaller freezers instead of one big one — it cools better and scales more.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices You Should Tattoo Somewhere

- Separate disks for **data** and **logs**
- Turn on **instant file init**
- Leave space for **IOPS spikes** (\~20% buffer)
- Store **backups on blob storage**
- Don’t let trace/error logs clog your system disk
- Strip disks for Premium SSDs — not Ultra Disk (it doesn’t help there)

---

## 🖥️ VM Sizing & Resizing

### What Matters:

- **RAM** = Cache = Faster reads
- **CPU** = Needed for licensing and processing
- **IOPS** = Actual workload throughput

> SQL Server is like a gourmet chef: give it enough memory (RAM) and it’ll cache dishes to serve instantly.

---

### 💰 Constrained Cores = Hack to Save Money

Let’s say:

- Your DB needs lots of **RAM** but doesn’t hit CPU hard
- But you’re being charged **per CPU core**

💡 Use a **constrained core VM**:

- Get full RAM + disk performance
- But pay license fees for fewer cores

> Like hiring a sous chef with access to the whole kitchen, but only paying them part-time 😎

---

### VM Types:

| Type             | Use For                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| General Purpose  | Most SQL workloads                      |
| Memory Optimized | Big RAM-hungry beasts (OLTP, analytics) |

➡️ You can **resize anytime** but there’s **brief downtime**.

## 📊 Database Storage Inside SQL (Especially for Managed Instances)

- **IOPS** and **Latency** = Key metrics
- Azure picks physical disks in SQL DB — you focus on performance tiers instead

> Don’t micromanage the waiter, just choose the right menu (tier).

---

## 📂 TempDB: Your Scratchpad

Used for temp tables, sorting, intermediate results — it must be:

- On fast SSD
- Have **multiple evenly sized files**
- Configured per vCore (default: 1 file per vCore)

> Like having multiple prep stations for slicing veggies — if all chefs use one table, it’s chaos.

---

## ⚙️ Tuning with MAXDOP

- Controls **parallel query execution**
- High MAXDOP = faster queries, more RAM
- Low MAXDOP = stable system under heavy load

Use it like:

- `ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION SET MAXDOP = 4;`

> Like letting a team of chefs work on one dish — faster, but messier.

## 🧑‍✈️ Resource Governor: The Boss You Didn’t Know You Needed

Let’s say 3 apps share one SQL Server:

- App A: Reporting (heavy queries)
- App B: Online orders (needs low latency)
- App C: Maintenance (runs at night)

Without Resource Governor:

> Reporting job kicks off → App B slows down → Users scream.

With Resource Governor:

- Reporting gets capped CPU
- Orders run smooth
- Maintenance waits its turn

✅ You can set:

- CPU % caps
- Memory % allocations
- IO limits per pool
- Assign users/workloads via T-SQL function

---

## 🔥 Final TL;DR

- **Storage**: Use the right disk, separate data/logs, cache smartly.
- **VMs**: Size right, use constrained cores if needed.
- **TempDB**: Place it on local SSD, balance the files.
- **MAXDOP**: Balance performance and memory usage.
- **Resource Governor**: Keep noisy neighbors in check.
