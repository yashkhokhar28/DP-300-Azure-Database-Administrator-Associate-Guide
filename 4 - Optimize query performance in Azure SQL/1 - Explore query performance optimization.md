## 🚀 **SQL Server Performance Tuning — Real World, No BS Summary**

---

### 🔍 1. **Query Execution Plans – Your GPS for SQL**

> Think of this like Google Maps for SQL. It shows the route SQL Server takes to answer your query.

- **Slow performance?** Look here first.
- If it's doing a **full table scan** instead of an **index seek**, that’s like taking backroads instead of the expressway.
- You can spot **missing indexes**, **expensive joins**, and **bad memory estimates** here.

**Example:**
You run a report that takes 5 minutes. Open the execution plan → see a big fat **Clustered Index Scan** → add an index → query drops to 3 seconds. Boom. Done.

---

### 📦 2. **Query Store – Your Black Box Recorder**

> This tracks query performance over time, like a flight recorder for SQL.

- **Before Query Store:** Queries go slow, and the "why" disappears into the void.
- **With Query Store:** You can **see regressions**, **force good plans**, and **analyze trends**.

**Example:**
You upgrade a stored proc. Everything breaks. Query Store shows it used to run in 1 sec but now takes 12. You **force the old plan** = issue solved in 2 minutes.

---

### 🔒 3. **Locking & Blocking – SQL Traffic Jams**

> SQL Server locks data so people don’t step on each other’s toes. But too many locks = traffic jam.

- **Locking = Good** (consistency).
- **Blocking = Bad** (slows down everything).
- **Deadlocks = SQL flips a coin and kills one process.**

**Example:**
User A updates a table. User B tries to read it. B waits... and waits… and calls IT.
→ You find an open transaction that forgot to `COMMIT`. Rookie mistake, big headache.

---

### 🧪 4. **Isolation Levels – Pick Your Poison**

> More consistency = less concurrency. Less locking = more risk of dirty reads.

- **Read Uncommitted:** Fast, but you might see “ghost” data.
- **Serializable:** Safe, but can cause **serious** blocking.
- **Snapshot/RC Snapshot:** Best of both worlds. Uses **row versioning** so reads don't block writes.

**Example:**
An e-commerce app uses `Read Committed`. During checkout, it reads stale stock data. Switch to **Snapshot Isolation** to prevent angry customers ordering out-of-stock items.

---

### 📊 5. **Statistics – The Crystal Ball for SQL’s Brain**

> SQL Server guesses how many rows your query will return. Bad guesses = bad plans.

- **Stats out of date?** Query might get **too much memory** or pick the **wrong join method**.
- **Fix:** `UPDATE STATISTICS`.

**Example:**
Query estimated 1,000 rows. Actual = 1,000,000. You see a huge memory grant + spill to tempdb.
Update stats → better estimate → plan uses hash join → performance saved.

---

### 🧠 6. **Parameter Sniffing – Sneaky Performance Killer**

> SQL Server builds a plan using the first parameter value it sees. If it’s not "typical," everyone suffers.

**Example:**
`GetOrders(@CustomerID)` runs great for ‘Amazon’ (100 rows) but terrible for ‘Walmart’ (10M rows).
Fix with `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` or `OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN`.

---

### 🔧 7. **DMVs – The SQL Server Spy Tools**

> Want to see what’s going on under the hood? Use DMVs (Dynamic Management Views).

- See what queries are running
- Monitor blocking, CPU usage, missing indexes
- Works like SQL’s own version of Task Manager

**Example:**
Use `sys.dm_exec_requests` and `sys.dm_tran_locks` to catch a blocking chain during peak hours → find one long-running update with no index → fix the index → servers breathe again.

---

### 📈 8. **Execution Plans: Estimated vs Actual**

| Estimated            | Actual                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| No execution needed  | Must run the query             |
| Shows guesses        | Shows real data (rows, memory) |
| Design-time analysis | Runtime troubleshooting        |

**Pro tip:** Use **Actual Plan** when debugging, but **don’t spam it in prod**—it ain’t cheap.

---

### ⚙️ 9. **Lightweight Query Profiling – Plan Visibility Without the Lag**

> Want actual plan info without crushing performance? Use Lightweight Profiling.

- Enabled by default in SQL 2019+ and Azure SQL.
- Use hints or trace flags to turn it on per-query or globally.

### 💣 10. **Top 5 Reasons Your Query Sucks**

| 💀 **Problem**               | 💡 **Fix**                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing indexes              | Add indexes for WHERE/JOIN columns               |
| Outdated stats               | `UPDATE STATISTICS`                              |
| Non-SARGable queries         | Rewrite to use indexable predicates              |
| Parameter sniffing           | Recompile or use `OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN`          |
| Blocking / long transactions | Find & fix open transactions or isolation levels |

## ✅ TL;DR for the Real World:

If your SQL Server feels slow:

1. Look at the **execution plan** – it's your cheat sheet.
2. Use **Query Store** to see what changed over time.
3. Watch for **blocking**—open transactions kill concurrency.
4. Tune your **indexes**, **stats**, and **query logic**.
5. Don’t guess. Use **DMVs** to spy on what's really happening.

Wanna debug SQL like a pro?
👉 Start with: `Ctrl + M` (Actual Plan) + `sys.dm_exec_requests` + `Query Store reports`.

That’s your real-world SQL Server survival kit.
